# airbnb-clone-project


## Team Roles
This is an airbnb-clone-project built with python
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
- Users

Represents individuals using the platform, either as property owners or renters.


Relationships:

A user can own multiple properties.

A user can make multiple bookings.

A user can leave multiple reviews.

- Properties

Represents property listings on the platform.


Relationships:

   A property belongs to one user (the owner).

   A property can have many bookings and reviews.

- Bookings

Tracks reservations made by users for properties.

Relationships:

  A booking belongs to one user and one property.

  A booking can have an associated payment.

- Payments

Handles transactions for bookings.

Relationships:

  A payment belongs to one booking.

- Reviews

User-generated reviews for properties.


Relationships:

  A review is associated with one user and one property.


## Feature Breakdown

- User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication ensures secure access to personal data and user-specific features such as bookings and reviews.
üèòÔ∏è Property Management

- Property owners can create, update, and delete property listings. This feature enables hosts to showcase their properties with details like images, pricing, and descriptions.
üìÖ Booking System

- Users can view available properties and make bookings for specific dates. This system handles check-in/check-out information and ensures no overlapping reservations occur.
üí≥ Payment Processing

- Handles secure payment transactions for property bookings. It verifies payment details and marks bookings as confirmed once payment is successful.
‚≠ê Review System

- Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they‚Äôve stayed at. This builds trust within the platform and helps future renters make informed decisions.
üöÄ API & Integration


## API Security

- Authentication

What it is: Users must log in using valid credentials to receive an access token (e.g., JWT). This token is then required for accessing protected endpoints.
Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and private actions such as bookings, payments, or property management.

- Authorization

What it is: Ensures users can only perform actions they are allowed to‚Äîfor example, only property owners can modify their listings.
Why it's important: Prevents malicious or accidental access to data that doesn‚Äôt belong to the authenticated user, protecting user privacy and platform integrity.
 
- Rate Limiting

What it is: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe.
Why it's important: Helps mitigate abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by slowing down or blocking suspicious traffic.

- Secure Payment Handling

What it is: Payments are processed through secure gateways and sensitive payment data is never stored directly.
Why it's important: Ensures financial data is protected and the booking process remains trustworthy for all users.
üß™ Input Validation & Data Sanitization

What it is: All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS).
Why it's important: Protects the application from attacks that could compromise data or functionality.

- HTTPS & Data Encryption

What it is: All API communication is secured over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Why it's important: Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and eavesdropping on sensitive information like passwords or personal data.
